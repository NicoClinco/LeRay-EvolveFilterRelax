# EvolveFilterRelax approach to filter the compressible navier stokes equations

This repository contains the class "FilterStep" which contains several methods
in order to filter the compressible-Navier-Stokes equations.

There are also three solver that use this class:

EFlinear :  Solve the compressible navier-stokes equation & apply the linear filter

EFgrad :  Solve the compressible navier-stokes equation & apply the linear filter

EFdecon : Solve the compressible navier-stokes equation & apply the linear filter
